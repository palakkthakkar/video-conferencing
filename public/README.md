# Video Conferencing Project

This project is a video conferencing application that enables users to have video calls using the Socket.IO and WebRTC APIs. It provides various features to enhance the meeting experience, including creating chat rooms, muting/unmuting microphones, turning video on/off, leaving the meeting, meeting recording, displaying usernames, messaging within the meeting, screen sharing, and a file sharing system.

## Features

1. **Creating Chat Rooms:** Users can create chat rooms to host video conferences. Each chat room has a unique identifier and allows multiple participants to join.

2. **Muting/Unmuting of Mics:** During the meeting, participants have the option to mute or unmute their microphones, allowing them to control their audio output.

3. **Turning Video On/Off:** Participants can turn their video feed on or off based on their preference or network limitations. This feature provides flexibility for participants who may have limited bandwidth.

4. **Leaving the Meeting:** Participants can easily leave the meeting at any time, disconnecting from the video call and chat room.

5. **Meeting Recording:** The application allows for meeting recording, enabling participants to capture the video conference for future reference or sharing. This feature ensures important discussions are not lost.

6. **Displaying Usernames:** Usernames of participants are displayed during the meeting, providing a clear identification of who is present in the conference.

7. **Messaging in the Meet:** Users can send text messages within the meeting, facilitating real-time communication and collaboration alongside the video call.

8. **Screen Sharing:** Participants can share their screens with others in the meeting. This allows for presentations, demonstrations, and collaborative work on shared content.

9. **File Sharing System:** The application provides a file sharing system, allowing participants to exchange files during the meeting. This feature enhances collaboration and enables the sharing of relevant documents or resources.

## Tech Stacks

The video conferencing project is built using the following technologies:

- HTML: Markup language used for structuring the user interface of the application.
- CSS: Styling language used for visually enhancing the appearance of the application.
- JavaScript: Programming language used for implementing the application logic and interactivity.
- Socket.IO: JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
- WebRTC API: Web-based Real-Time Communication API used for establishing peer-to-peer audio and video connections between clients.

## Setup and Installation

To run the video conferencing project locally, follow these steps:

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Video_conferencing_project
   ```

3. Start the application server, based on the server implementation provided in the project.
  
4. Open the `http://localhost:3000/action.html` file in a web browser.



5. You can now create chat rooms, join video calls, and utilize the various features of the video conferencing project.
